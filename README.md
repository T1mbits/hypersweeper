# Hypersweeper
A highly efficient multi-dimensional event-driven minesweeper clone backend.

idk this project has a 86% chance of just dying so I'll refrain from setting up a proper README for now but if you want to read more just check out lib.rs

## TODO
- [ ] Simple multi-dimensional board and tile implementation
- [ ] Overly complicated multi-dimensional board and tile implementation
- [x] Events system
- [ ] Board and tile traits
